# Epic-VM

## Overview
**Epic VM** is a fun project I intend to build incrementally as I test my skills in System Programming using Go lang.
This is an Implementation of a Virtual Machine in Go.
It'll be built for a longtime with an inspiration from **C/C++** and following the architectural constructs of the HEC Virtual Machine by Bill Blunden.

## Features
- For now I'm focusing on the low level works and architecture I'll keep updating this as time goes by.
